   1.2 Compiling tool version: gcc 4.6.3 or higher, GNU Make version 3.81

2. Put the package TL-WR940NV6_GPL.tar.gz to a directory such as /home/TP-LINK, then extract the compressed files.
   $ cd /home/TP-LINK
   $ tar xzvf TL-WR940NV6_GPL.tar.gz

To Build Firmware image:
   1.1 Go to TL-WR940NV6_GPL build folder and execute make.
   $ cd /home/TP-LINK/TL-WR940NV6_GPL/build
   $ make
   will generate the wr940nv6_ca_(xxx).bin, under TL-WR940NV6_GPL/images/wr940nv6_ca folder.
